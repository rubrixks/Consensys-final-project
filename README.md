#The Game

Concept:

Im sorry to whoever is looking at this final project, for I have made you lose the game.
If you do not know the rules, or if this is your first time hearing of this, here is wikipedia link for reference.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_(mind_game)

This project is focusing on the meme side of the cryptocommunity, but there is no intention of over promising.
The use case is simple. If anyone in the world thinks of The Game, instead of posting their L on reddit or twitter,
 the individual can mint an NFT for .0001 Ether.
Why blockchain technology? This is now the best way to record and announce to the world that someone have lost The Game for generations to come.
It would be difficult to search through social medias and other sites to determine how many people have lost. 
By having a decentralized immutable ledger, anyone in the world can see and count who and how many people have lost The Game.

Work Flow:

1.Users will visit the website and be offered two options to mint an NFT.

    A.Solo Lost Game

    B.Lost Game by Friend/Used to make a friend/stranger lose the game
    
2.Both option A. & option B. will show a metamask extension when a user clicks the mint button. the metamask extension will pop up 
and ask for .0001 Ether to mint the NFT.
