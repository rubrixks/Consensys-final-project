#The Game

Concept:

Im sorry to whoever is looking at this final project, for I have made you lose The Game.
If you do not know the rules, or if this is your first time hearing of this, here is the wikipedia link for reference.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_(mind_game)


This project is focusing on the meme'ers of the internet, but there is no intention of over promising.
The use case is simple. If anyone in the world thinks of The Game, instead of posting their L on reddit or twitter,
 the individual can mint the Lost NFT for .00025 Ether.
Why blockchain technology? This is now the best way to record and announce to the world that someone have lost The Game for generations to come.
It would be difficult to search through social medias and other sites to determine how many people have lost. 
By having a decentralized immutable ledger, anyone in the world can see and count what addresses have lost The Game.

Work Flow:

1.Users will visit the website and be first be shown a description of what The Game is, and why this was made. 
2.The option to mint the NFT will display.
3.Once clicked, Metamask will pop up.
4.Send transaction.
